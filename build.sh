# Imagine our service is called myannotator
docker build -t myannotator_image .

# Create container with specific name
# Source path has to be absolute
# Mem limits are specified at this time (create or run time) with
# -m 5g

# Env can be handled with this.
# docker create -e MYVAR1 --env MYVAR2=foo --env-file ./env.list 
# However env can also be hardcoded into the Dockerfile, at build time.
# EXPOSE is the big one.

# The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. It functions as a
# type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who
# runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published. To actually
# publish the port when running the container, use the -p flag on docker run to
# publish and map one or more ports, or the -P flag to publish all exposed ports
# and map them to high-order ports.


# docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:8080/tcp ubuntu bash
#  This binds port 8080 of the container to TCP port 80 on 127.0.0.1 of the host
# > machine. You can also specify udp and sctp ports. The Docker User Guide explains
# > in detail how to manipulate ports in Docker.

# $ docker run --expose 80 ubuntu bash

# This exposes port 80 of the container without publishing the port to the host
# systemâ€™s interfaces.
